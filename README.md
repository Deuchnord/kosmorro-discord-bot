# Kosmorro Discord WebHook

A script that computes the astronomical events of the day and sends them to a Discord webhook.
The script uses [Kosmorrolib](https://kosmorro.space/lib) to do the computations.

## How to use it on my Discord server?

1. First, [create a webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)
2. Fork this repository
3. Add a secret to your fork:
    - **Name:** `DISCORD_WEBHOOK`
    - **Value:** the URL of the webhook generated by Discord

The script will be executed every day at 6:30 AM UTC (because it is adapted to French timezones). If you want it to be executed at another time, change the `cron` option in [`discord-workflow.yml`](.github/workflows/discord-webhook.yml) with [a Cron-compliant syntax](https://crontab.guru).

## I don't speak French :'(

Feel free to change the strings to adapt to your locale :)

## Can I change the timezone?

For the moment, there is no facilities for this, but something will probably be done in the future.

## Why is this not on the [Kosmorro](https://github.com/Kosmorro) organization?

Even though I am the creator of Kosmorro, this is mostly an amusement and is not officially part of the project.
